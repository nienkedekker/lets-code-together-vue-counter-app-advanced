# About

This app was created for the React/Vue workshop held during the 8 February 2020 Let's Meet Together meet-up.

This is the *Vue* version for *advanced participants*: [find its React counterpart here](https://github.com/Marleintje/counter-app-react-vue-workshop-beginners). Looking for the beginners' version? [Go here](https://todo).

- Meet-up organizer: Vanessa Ho
- Workshop organizers: Nienke Dekker & Marlein Rusch

## Setup
Either set up the project locally by cloning it, or by using CodeSandbox.

### CodeSandbox
If you're using CodeSandbox, you won't have to worry about installing anything locally. You'll also be able to use the online VSCode Editor! Click the button below, or follow the steps manually:

TODO

1. Go to [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) and click on "Create Sandbox".
2. Then choose "Import Project" and copy this repository's URL: `todop`
3. Click "Generate Sandbox" and give it a few seconds to boot up!

### Setting it up locally
If you'd rather use your local dev environment, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repo: `todo`
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `yarn run serve` for local development -- follow the instructions to find the URL to your app!
4. Run `yarn run build` to compile for production

## Workshop goals

Participants should be able to answer the following questions:

- Why use a front-end framework like React/Vue?
- What are the most important differences between React and Vue?
- What are React/Vue components?
- What is state management?

Participants can:

- Set up a React or Vue app
- Integrate CSS into the project
- Make and apply a reusable component
- Manage state (on component level)
